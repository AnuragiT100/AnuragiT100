##  About Me

I'm a **licensed civil engineer** with versatile experience in field investigations, geotechnical modeling, soil laboratory analysis, and academic research. I'm passionate about advancing **granular mechanics**, **soil-structure interaction**, and **energy-geotechnics** through data-driven and simulation-based approaches.

My goal is to pursue **research-driven opportunities** focused on multiphase granular flow, geohazards, and computational geomechanics, contributing to resilient infrastructure in a changing climate.
